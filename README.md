# The Case for a Bike Share Opportunity in Des Moines
## Overview
### Purpose
-	A dataset was provided that included information regarding the New York City (NYC) bike share service for the month of August 2019.  A request was made to assess the feasibility of a bike share in Des Moines, Iowa based on the NYC data.
### Discussion
-	Des Moines is significantly different relative to NYC: Des Moines Metropolitan Area Population was 699,292 in 2019 versus NYC Metropolitan Area Population of 19,232,494 (also in 2019) which includes a significant portion of New Jersey and extends into Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
-	However, the NYC bike share service covers a much smaller area: The NYC bike share operates primarily in Manhattan with some traffic to nearby destinations in adjacent boroughs (exclusively Brooklyn and Queens; no routes were indicated to or from the Bronx or Staten Island) and Governor’s Island. 
-	Nevertheless, even though the NYC bike share covers a relatively small part of NYC, the population of that small part still dwarfs that of Des Moines with Manhattan alone coming in at over 1.6 Million persons in a 2020 Census. 
-	There is an avid bike ridership both in Des Moines and through out the state of Ohio as can be seen by the “Ragbrai” participation over the years:    https://ragbrai.com/about/ragbrai-history-factoids/
## Results  
-	The full storyboard can be found here: [Bike Share in Des Moines](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/robert8814/viz/NYCDesMoinesBikeShareStory/BikeShareinDesMoines)
-	
-	The typical ride was less than an hour.

-	
-	Males dominated the bike share.

-	Rides peaked before and after work on weekdays and more in the middle of the day on weekends.

-	
-	All riders appeared to have similar peak periods regardless of gender specified.

-	Subscribers were more active than other Customers. Also, customers (i.e., non-subscribers) were more likely to not specify gender.

## Summary
### Bottom Line: 
-	Des Moines is significantly different relative to NYC 
-	Nevertheless, as of 2019, Des Moines appears ripe for a bike share. 
### Further Work
-	One or more visualizations indicating the spread of ages or age ranges would be interesting. 
-	A bar chart of peak usage hours for the dataset was prepared but not used in the storyboard. A bar chart or similar visualization breaking down peak usage hours by gender could be helpful. 
### An Interesting Anecdote: Des Moines now has a bike share service
